I am planning to maintain el8, el9 rpms and deb package for bookworm, trixie Debian versions.
As a first step, el8 rpm and trixie deb files are being placed now. Remaining files will follow.

- el8 -> Rockylinux 8.9. Hope it should would work with RHEL8 and Almalinux8.
- el9 -> Rockylinux 9.3. Hope it should would work with RHEL9 and Almalinux9.
